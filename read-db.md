### **VolgaPay API Documentation**

**Introduction**

This repository provides documentation for the VolgaPay API, enabling integration with the VolgaPay payment platform.

**Prerequisites**

* A VolgaPay developer account with a valid `client_id` and `client_secret`.
* Basic understanding of HTTP and JSON.

**Authentication**

VolgaPay uses a client credentials flow for authentication. To obtain an access token, send a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint with your `client_id` and `client_secret`.

**Endpoint:**

```
https://api.volgapay.com/auth/login
```

**Method:** POST

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

**Successful Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Login successful",
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInRCJ9.eyJpZCI6MiwiaWF0IjoxNzMzOTY2NTcxLCJleHAiOjE3MzY1NTg1NzF9.Q_pp6hipX-5l2n4w2XHaEwQ72KyjRx6TliYIAWWVtvY",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_at": "2025-01-11T01:22:51.000Z"
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "API is disabled or Invalid client_id."
}
```

**Using the Access Token**

Include your access token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests using the `Bearer` scheme.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Next Steps**

* **Consult the official VolgaPay documentation:** For in-depth information on available endpoints and functionalities.
* **Explore code examples:** Refer to VolgaPay's provided code examples for your preferred programming language.
* **Create your integrations:** Utilize the VolgaPay API to implement payment functionalities in your application.

**Notes:**

* **Security:** Keep your `client_id` and `client_secret` confidential. Avoid exposing them in public repositories.
* **Token Expiration:** Access tokens have an expiration date. Renew them before they expire.
* **Limitations:** Refer to the official documentation for API usage limits, such as request rates and data size limits.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your application to handle potential API errors.
